## SQL Project: Supermarket Sales Analysis

### Overview:
This project involved using MySQL Workbench to analyze extensive sales data from a supermarket, aiming to uncover insights into revenue generation, identify top-selling branches, and segment customers. I examined popular products and payment methods while analyzing sales trends to understand seasonal patterns and growth trajectories.

Additionally, this technical report presents a series of SQL queries crafted to analyze a dataset with detailed sales transaction information. By employing various SQL techniques, we explored the data to identify significant trends, patterns, and anomalies. The results provided valuable insights into customer behavior, product performance, and overall business performance.
